# 0x05-regularization
In mathematics, statistics, finance,[1] computer science, particularly in machine learning and inverse problems, regularization is the process of adding information in order to solve an ill-posed problem or to prevent overfitting.[2]

Regularization applies to objective functions in ill-posed optimization problems. The regularization term, or penalty, imposes a cost on the optimization function for overfitting the function or to find an optimal solution.
